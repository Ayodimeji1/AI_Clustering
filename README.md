# Clustering Project

## Overview

This project focuses on applying clustering algorithmson a socio-economic dataset to understand patterns and relationships between various indicators, such as income, child mortality, imports, exports, and GDP. Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to identify patterns or groupings within a dataset. The project aims to identify clusters of countries based on similar characteristics, enabling insights into their socio-economic conditions. The project is presented as an interactive Jupyter Notebook that walks through the implementation, analysis, and visualization of clustering methods.
