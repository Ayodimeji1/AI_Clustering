## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates clustering analysis on a socio-economic dataset to understand patterns and relationships between various indicators, such as income, child mortality, imports, exports, and GDP. The project aims to identify clusters of countries based on similar characteristics, enabling insights into their socio-economic conditions.

## Featur


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand distributions and correlations

Data visualization for understanding relationships between different socio-economic indicators

Application of K-Means clustering to group countries with similar socio-economic profiles

Analysis of cluster characteristics to interpret socio-economic disparities

Feature scaling and visualization to enhance clustering results


### Installation

To run this project locally, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can set up a virtual environment and install the required dependencies as follows:

### Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/clustering-socio-economic.git
cd clustering-socio-economic

### Usage

To use the notebook, open it in Jupyter:

jupyter notebook Clustering.ipynb

Follow the instructions within the notebook to see the analysis, clustering, and evaluation steps.

## Project Details

### Exploratory Data Analysis

The project starts with an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics. Key indicators such as income, child_mort, life_expec, gdpp, imports, and exports are explored using visualizations like histograms and scatter plots. Insights about correlations between these factors are highlighted, such as:

A positive correlation between income and gdpp

A negative correlation between child_mort and life_expec

Relationships between total_fer (Total Fertility Rate) and child_mort

### Clustering

The notebook uses K-Means clustering to identify clusters of countries based on socio-economic factors. The features are standardized using StandardScaler to ensure all variables contribute equally to the clustering.

### Key findings include:

The existence of distinct clusters representing countries with similar socio-economic characteristics.

Insights into health, economic, and development levels in different regions.

The results are visualized using scatter plots and box plots, making it easier to interpret the clusters' characteristics.

## Model Evaluation

The quality of the clusters is evaluated using metrics such as Silhouette Score and by visually inspecting the consistency of the clusters. The clusters are analyzed to understand the socio-economic disparities among them, providing insights into income distribution, healthcare conditions, and overall development levels.

## Further Improvements

To enhance the analysis, several potential improvements are suggested:

Feature Engineering: Create more relevant variables or combine existing ones for a deeper understanding of the data.

Advanced Clustering Algorithms: Experiment with other clustering techniques like Agglomerative Clustering or DBSCAN for more robust clustering.

Geopolitical Factors: Incorporate geographical and geopolitical information to better understand the socio-economic context.

Advanced Visualization: Use interactive dashboards to make the results more accessible to stakeholders.
